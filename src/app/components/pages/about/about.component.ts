   Even though I had an artistic side,
    I chose the development path instead of the design due to my curiosity and interest in problem solving.
    After seeing how games impact peopleâ€™s lives, I decided to understand more about how to create and design them myself.
    The degree allowed me to obtain essential skills which enabled me to start a career as a software developer.
    I desire the developer path since it will enhance my abilities,
   knowledge and enable me to create more than just games. I want to be able to program and use a diverse range of technologies.`;
